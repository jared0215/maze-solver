# Maze Solver

This project implements a graphical maze solver using Python and Tkinter. The maze is generated with random walls, and the solver uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from the start to the end.

## Features

-   Random maze generation with customizable size
-   Visualization of maze generation and solving process
-   Depth-first search algorithm for solving the maze
-   Option to set a random seed for reproducibility

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jared0215/maze-solver

    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd maze-solver
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script to generate and solve the maze:

    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

2. Watch the maze being generated and solved in the graphical window.

## Project Structure

-   `src/`
    -   `main.py`: Main script to run the maze solver
